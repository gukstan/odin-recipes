# odin-recipes

So in this project I put together all that I learned from my previous projects (you can check those on my profile).
There is a main page, called "Recipes". Then there are 3 links that lead to the said recipes.
Inside those recipes, you will find in each one: a title, an image, a description, the ingredients, and the directions.
I hope you like it :P
